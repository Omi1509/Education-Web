          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
          example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
          whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
          student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
          critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
          disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
          education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities
          of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field
          studying education.

          The definition of education has been explored by theorists from
          various fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity
          aimed at achieving certain goals, which include the transmission of
          knowledge, skills, and character traits. However, there is extensive
          debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some
          theorists view education primarily as a process that occurs during
          educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning. Others
          perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this
          process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated
          persons. Additionally, the term may also refer to an academic field
          that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved
          in teaching and learning.

          The history of education studies the processes, methods, and
          institutions involved in teaching and learning. It tries to explain
          how they have interacted with each other and shaped educational
          practice until the present day. Education began in prehistory, as
          adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
          in their society. For the most part, there were no specialized
          teachers and most adults taught the youth, usually informally during
          everyday activities. Education was achieved through oral communication
          and imitation. It could take the form of storytelling and singing to
          pass knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
